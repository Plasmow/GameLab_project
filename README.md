🌉 Game Title: “Mind the Gap”
🎮 Game Description
You are a lone character standing on the edge of a mysterious chasm. To cross it, you must train your body and mind, and manage your hunger, energy, and emotions. Different stats unlock unique ways to overcome the gap — but push any stat too far, and you may meet an unexpected end.
Explore strange powers, defy logic, and experiment with different actions to discover multiple solutions to the same puzzle. It’s not just about crossing — it’s about how you cross.
